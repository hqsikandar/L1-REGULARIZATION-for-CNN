# L1-REGULARIZATION-for-CNN
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model optimized with L1 regularization for image classification tasks. The model is designed to address common challenges in CNN architectures, such as overfitting and underfitting, by incorporating L1 regularization into the CNN's architecture.
